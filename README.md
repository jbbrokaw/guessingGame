guessingGame
============

This is a guessing game just to guess a number & give higher lower hints. Depending on how it goes, I'd like to make it work with a web page (buttons to enter guesses, get hints, etc., maybe visual feedback). 
I ended up adding the standard prime number functions (just to practice syntax) and making the buttons work. A tiny bit of style stuff, but didn't really go far down that route. 

No collaoborators :(
Some reference from CodeAcademy tutorials, w3schools.com, etc. (basically Google very basic syntax stuff).
